    <h5>Scene.—Palace Yard, Westminster.  Westminster Hall, L.  Clock
        tower up, R.C. Private Willis discovered on sentry, R. Moonlight.</h5>

    <pre>                          <p>(Enter Fairy Queen.)</p>

        <h4>QUEEN.</h4>  <p>Oh, shame—shame upon you!  Is this your fidelity to
   the laws you are bound to obey?  Know ye not that it is death to
   marry a mortal?</p>
        <h4>LEILA.</h4>  <p>Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!</p>
        <h4>FLETA.</h4>  <p>If it were, you'd have to execute us all!</p>
        <h4>QUEEN.</h4>  <p>Oh, this is weakness!  Subdue it!</p>
        <h4>CELIA.</h4>  <p>We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!</p>
        <h4>LEILA.</h4>  <p>We are not all as tough as you are!</p>
        <h4>QUEEN.</h4>  <p>Tough!  Do you suppose that I am insensible to the
   effect of manly beauty?  Look at that man!  <p>(Referring to Sentry.)</p>
   A perfect picture!  <p>(To Sentry.)</p>  Who are you, sir?
        <h4>WILLIS <p>(coming to "attention").</p></h4>  <p>Private Willis, B Company,
   1st Grenadier Guards.</p>
        <h4>QUEEN.</h4>  <p>You're a very fine fellow, sir.</p>
        <h4>WILLIS.</h4>  <p>I am generally admired.</p>
        <h4>QUEEN.</h4>  <p>I can quite understand it.  <p>(To Fairies.)</p>  Now here is
   a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike.  That man has
   a most extraordinary effect upon me.  If I yielded to a natural
   impulse, I should fall down and worship that man.  But I mortify
   this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my feet!
   That is how I treat my regard for that man!</p>
 
                          SONG—FAIRY QUEEN.
                       <p> 
                         Oh, foolish fay,
                            Think you, because
                       His brave array
                            My bosom thaws,
                       I'd disobey
                            Our fairy laws?
                       Because I fly
                            In realms above,
                       In tendency
                            To fall in love,
                       Resemble I
                            The amorous dove?
   (Aside.)            Oh, amorous dove!
                            Type of Ovidius Naso!
                                 This heart of mine
                                 Is soft as thine,
                       Although I dare not say so!
 
   CHORUS.             Oh, amorous dove, etc.
 
                       On fire that glows
                            With heat intense
                       I turn the hose
                            Of common sense,
                       And out it goes
                            At small expense!
                       We must maintain
                            Our fairy law;
                       That is the main
                            On which to draw—
                       In that we gain
                            A Captain Shaw!
   (Aside.)                 Oh, Captain Shaw!
                                 Type of true love kept under!
                                      Could thy Brigade
                                      With cold cascade
                                 Quench my great love, I wonder!
 
   CHORUS.             Oh, Captain Shaw! etc.</p>
 
               <p>(Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen, sorrowfully.)</p></pre>
